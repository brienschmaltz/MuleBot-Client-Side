# MuleBot-Client-Side
 All python scripts and examples from the MuleBot project. 
 
 The only notable file is here: https://github.com/brienschmaltz/MuleBot-Client-Side/blob/main/Final%20Python%20Driver/Use_GPS_to_move.py
 
 This file is the final driver we completed. The bot did not completely work as intended but did move and follow, just not the user.
